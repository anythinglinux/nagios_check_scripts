This repository is a collection of scripts that I use. I've made these by gathering bits and pieces from across the interwebs. If you do see snippets of your code, then it means that you did something awesome that I wanted to include in my scripts. All these scripts are by no means perfect. Please test on a local test environment before you dump it to prod, okay?!
