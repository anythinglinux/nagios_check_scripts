This repository is a collection of scripts that I use. I've made these by gathering bits and pieces from across the interwebs. If you do see snippets of your code, then it means that you did something awesome that I wanted to include in my scripts. All these scripts are by no means perfect. I do infact run all these scripts in our production environment with great success.

Enjoy!
